In Unit 4, I learned to use HTML attributes to improve my client’s web page. I practiced adding the title and language attributes and created lists, adjusting their style with attributes. I also embedded images, sized them, and used the alt attribute for accessibility. I understood accessibility means making websites usable for everyone, including those using assistive tools. I explored accessibility tools and applied the alt attribute to make my web page inclusive. This unit helped me make web pages more functional and accessible. I’m excited to keep improving my client’s site.

* HTML attributes

  * title="text" eg.`<p title="Additional info">`Text `</p>`
  * lang="language-code" e.g. `<html lang="en">`
* List

  * Ordered list: `<ol><li>`Item `</li></ol>`
  * Unordered list: `<ul><li>`Item `</li></ul>`
  * Description list:`<dl>`
    `<dt>`text `</dt>`
    `<dd>`text explain `</dd>`
    `<dt>`text2 `</dt>`
    `<dd>`text2 explain `</dd>`
    `</dl>`
* Images(alt is when the image is not loaded the word in alt will be shown)

  * Image tag: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" width="200" height="100">`
  * Relative link: `<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="Photo">`
  * Absolute link: `<img src="https://example.com/photo.jpg" alt="Photo">`
