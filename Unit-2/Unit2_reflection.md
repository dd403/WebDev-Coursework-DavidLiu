In Lesson 1, I learned about design principles such as balancing user experience, aesthetics, and function. These are the same things that I learned from Mr.Wolferstan. I observe products to know what design decisions were made and looked at websites for UI and UX. This made me understand how important about desgin.

Lesson 2 introduced me to the Design Thinking Process. It's a process of solving problems through understanding users, discovering problems, ideating, prototyping, and testing. I learned that it's essential in developing products that humans will truly need.

Both courses helped me learn how to think about users while designing. I would like to implement these principles in my future work.
