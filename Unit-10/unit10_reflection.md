In this lesson, I learned how to create a navigation bar and link different HTML pages like Home, About, and Contact. I also learned how to use CSS to style the navigation bar to make it look better and more user-friendly. At first, I found it a bit hard to organize the files and folders, but after some practice, it became easier. Now I understand how to keep my HTML, CSS, and images in the right place, which helps the website work well. I also learned that a good design should be simple and easy to use. This lesson helped me think more about the user when I make a website. I feel more confident now to build a multi-page website and show my work to others.

`<link rel="stylesheet"href="style.css">`

`<script type="text/javascript"src="script.js"></script>`
