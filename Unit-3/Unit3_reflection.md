I studied the Client Web Page project in Unit 3 and began the Design Thinking Process to develop a web page for a client. I create an interview with my client to learn about their requirement. I also developed ideas for the web page layout and began building a simple web page to meet the client's needs. I find that reading sample client interview notes was very useful in the exercise of identification of different client needs. This unit teach me to discover how to use the Design Thinking Process in an actual project. I was able to understand the significance of listening to the client and using their feedback to inform the design.
