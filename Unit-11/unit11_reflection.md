This course helped me learn how to make a website. First, I learned the history of the Internet and how websites work. Then I learned how to use HTML to make a basic web page. After that, I used CSS to change the colors, text, and layout to make the website look better. I also learned a little bit of JavaScript to make my website do simple things like showing a message when I click a button. I learned about the UN Global Goals and how websites can share important ideas. I also learned about accessibility, like using image alt text to help more people use the website. At the end of the course, I used everything I learned to make a better website. I feel proud of what I made, and now I understand how to build a website from the beginning.
