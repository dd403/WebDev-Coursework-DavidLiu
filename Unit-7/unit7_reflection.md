This lesson about the Global Goals was very interesting and useful. I learned about the 17 Goals and their targets, which help solve big problems in the world, like poverty and climate change. The Global Goals website has a clear and nice design, making it easy to understand the information. I also liked using the Design Thinking Process to plan a website for a Goal that matters in my community. I chose a target that feels important locally and started designing a simple website to share ideas and encourage action. The lesson was clear, but sometimes it felt a bit difficult to connect global ideas to my own area. I think more examples would help. Overall, it made me feel excited to think about how I can help with these global problems.
