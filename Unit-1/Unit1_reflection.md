In Unit 1, I learned about the Internet’s history and basic web development. I also learned about the World Wide Web, which connects devices with IP addresses. Web browsers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show websites, and servers answer requests.
Then, I practiced coding a web page with HTML tags for title, header, and paragraph. I learned tags for formatting also the commenting code is useful to make it readable and for debugging.
This unit helped me understand the Internet and basic coding. I’m excited to learn more about web development.
