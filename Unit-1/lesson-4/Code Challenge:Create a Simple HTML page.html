        <h1><b>Dallas Road Cliffs</b></h1>
        <hr>
        <p> The Dallas Road cliffs cast echoes of light<br>
            across a softening percussion of waves.<br>
            The day is dying<br>
            and people are leaving<br>
            for the listing boats of sleep.<br></p>
            
             
            
        <p>Consenting to your fading horizon,<br>
            you stay in place, waiting<br>
            on the slow birds of night.<br>
            Still, how beautiful the next breath,<br>
            how liberating this unhurried hour, <br>
            how surprising the extempore prayer â€“<br></p>
            
             
            
        <p>how <I>crucial</I>, the unbidden poem,<br>
            like a sacred friend,<br>
            who names your sorrow,<br>
            fills the hollows with hope,<br>
            beacons out a gentle way.</p>
